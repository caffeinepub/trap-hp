  "summary": "Frontend adds a weight+trap-speed calculator UI with client-side validation and a results panel, plus theme styling. However, backend computation/canister integration is incorrect/missing, required generated image assets are not present in the diff, and the results reset action is not implemented in the results panel. The diff also introduces Internet Identity/auth-related hooks (a stated non-goal) and a different horsepower calculation (torque/rpm) in the backend.",

      "requirement": "Implement the horsepower calculation in the Motoko backend as a query method (weight + trap speed) and have the frontend call it; show a clear error state on backend failure.",
      "reason": "Backend method signature and formula do not match (uses torque/rpm), and the frontend performs the calculation locally with a simulated delay rather than calling the canister. No backend failure error state is evidenced.",
